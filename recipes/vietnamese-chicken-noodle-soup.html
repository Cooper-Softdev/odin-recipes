                A family favorite recipe! Now I am not Vietnamese, but this <strong>IS</strong> a family favorite. 
                Not of my family mind you, but of some family somewhere... probably.

                We're trying to be a bit more worldy so we're making dishes
                from around the world. And then significantly changing something
                inherently fundamental about the dish as a sign of respect 
                for the culture... as you do.
