                I love shirataki noodles. When prepared correctly,
                they provide a wonderful keto, low-carb, and gluten-free 
                alternative to noodles and pasta. I normally prepare them 
                by boiling and dry-roasting them. Then I simply toss them 
                with butter, garlic, and Parmesan.
            </p>

                But a few months ago I decided to try using them in a 
                sesame noodles recipe. Success! These noodles are delicious, 
                flavorful, and super-filling. I've been making this recipe 
                regularly ever since. Today, I'm sharing it with you.
